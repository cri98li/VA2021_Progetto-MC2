# Project for Visual Analytics Course @ UniPi

[DEMO](https://cri98li.github.io/VA2021_Progetto-MC2/)

Course description:

> The availability of large data sources provides new opportunities for understanding
patterns and behaviors of modern society. The information from these sources requires effective visualization methods to extract meaningful information from the data
and facilitate the interpretation of very complex phenomena. The objective of the
course is to present an overview of basic methods and visualization techniques for
effective presentation of information from different sources: structured data (relational hierarchies, trees), relational data (social networks), temporal data, spatial data
and data space-time. We will present and discuss several case study scenarios with
the existing methods and tools.

Syllabus:

Visual Metaphors for Information:

- Hierarchical and structured data.
- Relational and graph-based data.
- Temporal Data.
- Spatial data.
- Spatio-temporal data.
- Unstructured information (text).
